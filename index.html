        <h1>Kraftwagen</h1>
        <p>Kraftwagen is a set of tools aimed at 
          <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> developers. It intends to 
          provide automation for a <em>everything in 
          code</em> and <em>install profile</em>/<code>drush make</code> based 
          workflow. Techically, it consists of a 
          <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a>
          extension and a few Drupal modules.</p>

      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        When developing larger Drupal based projects, without any tools it 
        becomes very cumbersome to deploy new versions, work efficiently with 
        team members, etc. This is because Drupal tends to store everything in
        the database, including all configuration and all other things you would
        rather hard-code for your client. Some initiative have been started to
        changes this, most notably being the 
        <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features</a> module. 
        However, there a still a lot of things that will, nor can, ever be build
        into Features. Kraftwagen aims to be a tool that glues together the 
        existing tools and fills the gaps.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        When we started developing Krafwagen, we set a few goals to reach. Below
        you'll find a list of them with some explaination.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Everything in code</dt>
        <dd>We wanted to make sure all the required information to run an 
          application or website is in the source code. If some developer checks
          out the project from our Git repository, she should be able the get it
          running, without a lot of manual steps in Drupal or copying around
          large database dumps.
        </dd>

        <dt>Don't reinvent the wheel</dt>
        <dd>A lot of effort has already been done in this area and we wanted to
          build on top of that. That's why Kraftwagen uses the Features module
          and is build completely on top of Drush. Some of the most used 
          Kraftwagen commands are only thin convience wrappers around existings 
          commands or sequences of commands. This also means that most concepts
          in Kraftwagen should sound familiar to any seasoned Drupal developer.
        </dd>

        <dt>Version control independence</dt>
        <dd>
          We didn't want a tool that locks us completely with Subversion, Git or
          any other version control mechanism. Of course with serious projects
          you'll really want some sort of version control, but your toolchain
          should not depend on it. <em>Currently, there is one Git dependend 
          command. The command to start a new project uses Git to download the 
          skeleton. We are looking at a way to elegantly solve this, while 
          keeping the convenience of the current command.</em>
        </dd>

        <dt>Environment awareness</dt>
        <dd>
          Drupal itself doesn't make any difference between production and 
          development enviroments. In production you'll want the 
          <a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel">Devel</a> module disabled,
          while in development environments it should be enabled. When copying
          around database dumps this is almost impossible to do automatically.
